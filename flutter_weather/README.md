## Notes
The app requests for the users permission to access current location and then displays the weather based on the device's location.
The features mentioned in the stretch goals are not included in the app
### Date
Jan 24, 2021
### Instructions for how to build & run the app
App is built using Android Studio. Connecting any hardware device and pressing the play button will launch the app. Android device is preferred for this due to ease of use.
### Time spent
40  hours. Being a native mobile app developer, I spent time on reading and implementing the hybrid solution. The time spent on this project includes the setup and installation of Android Studio, Flutter SDK, Dart programming language and cross platform device setup.
### Assumptions made
Added a refresh button to help refresh the weather data
### Shortcuts/Compromises made
If I had much more familiarity with the platform, I would have implemented the features mentioned in the stretch goals.
### Why did you choose the technology/framework you used?
I chose flutter over react native as the setup was easier when compared to other options.
### Stretch goals attempted
A couple of methods produced errors during implementation, specially the location framework of dart. Debugging the error and fixing the issue took significant amount of time and hence the stretch goals could not be worked on.
### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?
I initially developed a horizontal scroll widget to display the next 15 days forecast data. After realising that it was not a requirement I deleted the widget and related code.
### Other information about your submission that you feel it's important that we know if applicable.
